# sprint-planner
A simple sprint planning tool using Angular

I started creating this because I am working with a team to develop a game and we were unable to find a good free sprint planning tool to use for our purposes. 

Currently this is not in a usable state due to complications in moving the application to github. I will fix this in the future.
